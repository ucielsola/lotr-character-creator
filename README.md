# LOTR RPG Character Creator

Hi! Welcome to my first JavaScript project.

This is a very simple Character Creator for an (yet) unexisting The Lord of the Rings RPG. 
I've built it using HTML5, CSS5 and jQuery as my Final Project for the JavaScript Course at [CODERHOUSE](coderhouse.com)

You can choose a Name, Gender, Race, Class, Background and a custom Story for your Character, and then print it out to a PDF File.

( pst!! There's an easter egg hidden in the ring ;) )
